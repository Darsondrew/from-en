## Existence Versus Non-Existence

We dey talk say “warin nor dey exist” and warin nor carry weight or power, or carry d beta change for weight or power, like to find d join body of gravity.

God nor carry weight or energy, or show d effects of mass or energy – God nor fix be detectable or verifiable at all, shape or form, weather na wit human being senses or wit rationality.

ok, if I talk say “God dey,” warin I dey talk be dat na:

“*anything way dey live must be detectable; God nor fit  be detect by man, but God dey – as e be say warin nor dey exist, be dey exit.*” 

E-hen as we dey talk say “God dey,” I don make and stand gidigba. I don show “warin dey exist ” as “ warin nor dey exist”, dis one come dey explain about dis life as something way nor get “life” , or rock as “nor be d same as rock” or as “square” or as a “circle”.

As d same, if I com make something different as in warin “nor dey exist na d same thing as watin dey exist” and confusion na d same as watin dey continue and nor dey stop” and “I say dis thing correct, and “lie na lie” and “watin nor dey equal na d same as watin dey equal” now watin I don do na warin “nor dey correct,” and all d things I put na lie, and talk say dis na place where lie com be com correct."[^2]

Warin dey now, people nor dey make dis “alternate universe” take am to invalidate warin dey right and correct inside our own universe, but na to safe warin be erroneous in reality, and com call am correct. For example nor body dey argue say “God fit dey for different universe, na so if no fit say God nor dey exist” or talk say “ e nor dey for another universe, na so me I nor fit talk say I exist here."

Dem nor if talk say or agree say dat: “ In another universe, u go gree with me say that God nor dey exit, I go talk say u be unbeliever.”[^3]

Na correct talks to say about reality nor get end opposed becos some think say realm called “lie na d same with truth talk” warin nor dey validates dem, den warin be dey self na “nor better talk abouth correct thing na really valid” – however, we know book as dose philosophers by now we don know say the talk dey confusing small, since na better talk to say dat na correct true e b dat means to say nor better talk b true. If something nor be true or lie – even dat talk – dem nor talk at all go fit make anything at all. When u dey use words, like using English, using comprehensible sentence – all of dem nor make sense at all, since in dis “alternative universe”  some structured utterance go fix be something make e no make senses at all. If something way fix be true in dis alternate universe come get effect on talk we make in dis universe, then we go truly know say the universe dey correct, dat is to say dat nor statements can ever fix make about anything, since dere exact opposite can be d same as true

D true reality of d statement be say “something way nor correct na d same with something way correct” is d tautological dey kolo of “null be d same as null”.

### The "Alternate Universe" In Human Society

D reason why we dey spend so much time dey hammer on dis “alternate universe” theory is dat it has direct relevance to where people dey live, and is used to “justify d greatest bad thing way dey committed among we people.

Warin we don see b/4, we know say to kpai no good at all. As we dey waka through d proposition dat kpai is totally not good at all in d above example, I strongly get am for mind dat any person go dey shocked to have their character/behavior instincts correct through d strict abstract reasoning of UPB. In dis part, however, e go be special permission for u to start to b truly stocked.  

D ogboge leaps for front in scientific watin get sense na d so-called “unifying theories. “Einstein spent plenty year com work  out a unified field theory; and theories of physics which com gather together ogboge and lazy forces, electromagnetism, gravity and so on remain elusive.

UPB way b framework, however, nor come believe our character inside us at d personal, philosophical and universal levels – but e com profound and shocking implications for where people dey live together. 

#### UPB In Action

D UPB framework com check character matching by asking dem dat dey be internally consistent, and universal in terms of time, place and individual.

If we com agree with UPB, we go also com agree d following corollary:

-  Behavior propositions are free of costume.

Warin dis one com mean be dat man no go fix change his behavior natural by d shirt e dey wear. D way to change person cloth no go fix change person look as him carry com for earth. To dey fight with character way get laws no go if make d cloth dat u dey wear change any thing at all.  

Soldier who be government people way dey stand for road dey carry stick, of course, wear their color cloths way no be d same as people who nor dey work for government. Dose people who nor join soldier cannot kpai; solders, however, dem nor get power to kpai any person but dem go still dey priased dem for kpaing.

Make we yam  about another example.

Theft na dose people way dey go steal other people things e nor good at all, as we don talk am for up there. E no good for every people who dey for situation all the times and under all circumstance. Since to thief somebody thing be say u dey take something by force from somebody hand or house and d person nor know or agree, then taxation is always, universally and nor good at all. Taxation come be like say dem dey by force dey collect person thing way d person nor know or agree, since taxation com rest on d initiation of to take force collect person property. 

As we dey call “government” na just another example of dis null zone where dey go say something way dey up na down, black na white, truth na lie and bad thing na good thing

Where things dey happen na d degree dat reason and evidence go make big thing leap from d personal to d universal, and com scatter any irrational null zones na d way. Where Science com make thing happen exactly to d degree dat dey nor agree d irrationality of God and subjective “absolutes.” Dose people who dey make medicine to d extend dat dey rejects d power of prayer and empty native juju, and instead believe say na their on studies and evidence beta or good pass. Philosophy also – and place where human being dey live and gather – will get and grow up high dat e nor agree with d irrational “square-circle character or behavior” of statist and religion ethical theories.

### Government

Dey are talking say dat d government work under opposite character rules way different from other community na d same thing we dey talk say “leprechauns are immune to gravity. “Frist of all, leprechauns nor dey exit – and one of d way which we go know say dem nor dey exist na by d thing dem dey claimed say dat dey are immune to gravity. Everything dat get weight na subject to gravity – dat one na immune to gravity by definition na e nor get mass, and d thing nor dey exist. D talk way dey ground “leprechauns are immune to gravity” na a tautology, dis one only com be true say na d non-existence of leprechauns – dis one com b d semantic equivalent of “dat which nor dey exist, nor dey exist.” A na A, Aristotle’s first law of logic, does precious little to confirm d existence of dat which is defined as non-existence.     

In de same way, as we dey talk say dat it is morally beta for soldiers to kpai and government people to thief, we know dat “soldiers” and “government peoples” dey get moral differently are *completely invalid*.  

If I talk say dat na square circle get de right to thief, I com dey talk say dat dat warin nor dey exist com get de right to do dat warin is self-contradictory – na clean nonsensical talk, but one warin remains strangely compelling in de “null zone” of politics.    

If I com buy one soldier’s cloth for blend down select shope, and I com wear am, so I nor com create an alternative universe warin different moral rules go fit be valid. De time before I com wear de fine cloth, e no good for me to kpai – which time e com becom correct for me to kpai? As I com wear de trousers? What of if I com wear only one shoe? What of if I com wear de two shoe, and only one shoe get role? What of if my cap dey face back? What of if I com wear de uniform dat nor be de same with de first person I com meet? Did de Beatles com get de power to kpai when dey fire de cover for “Sergeant Peppers”? Did dey lost dat power when dey remove dere coat.  

 I com ask dese rhetorical question becos dem dey in fact deadly serious. Clearly, a soldier fine cloth nor go fit change de way of a human being, any more than a cutting of his hair  nor go change am into a duck, a concept, or a god.    

“Ah,” you if talk say, “but de cloth/shirt nor be de right one becos you buy am for blend down select shop  – com wear de uniform of de soldier nor go fit make you resemble a soldier than to dey pretend to get a doctorate gives you a Ph.D”  

De example nor dey correct, becos getting a Ph.D. or pretending to get a doctorate nor go fit change any of de moral rules dat you dey bring to for as a human being.   

 “Well,” you may talk say, “but de different way dey is dat de soldier com get de moral rights dat are giving to him by de ordinary people, for de sake of  collective protecting  dem self and so on.”  

Dis com bring a very important point, which is de question of whether subjection go fit change every thing for life.   

### Opinions And Reality

Clearly, we com understand dat I nor go fit  with my subjection take release you from de restraints of gravity, as I dey subject dat “two plus two na five” com dey correct. 

“Subjections” na dose beliefs way nor get clear evidence in reality, or for nothing dey clear evidence go fit dey for ground, or which com show expressions of  ordinary personal preferences. My own subjection is dat I com like chocolate ice cream pass vanilla – I com get another “subjection” dat Iceland na a tropical paradise, or dat God dey, or dat rain dey fall go up. My own personal subjection com get nothing to do with morality; opinions dat  com claim say e dey accurately com show reality, but which nor be so, are merely nor dey correct prejudices. Believing dat de rain dey fall go up nor go fit change anything; com wear a Hawaiian cloth go Iceland nor go fit make Reykjavik fill warmer.      

 E-hen com believe say people way dey kpai people is morally beta nor fit make dem morally beta. Since I com believe dat a person nor go fit change his moral nature, my belief dat his kpai are virtuous nor go fit change de virtue of him action. If I com close my eyes and com dey think dat you be lizard, you nor com suddenly lost your sense to carry regulate your own body temperature. Imaging say dat you be fish nor fit bypass warin you need for scubs gear. 

  Subjection no dey change reality.

Becos subjection nor dey change reality, I nor fit permit you any exception or reversal which com get  regards to a universal moral rule. Since moral rules com stay for universal logic, as de physical nature and reality of a human being, I nor go allow you d “right to kpai somebody” not to talk say I com allow you de ability to levitate, waka on water or correctly talk say dat two and two go fit make five.     

### Government As Voluntarism

De open force way dey inside de institution of government – de conceptual wrapper dat change moral rules for a particular people way gather together – na something dat na always  kept off de table in debates. When we dey talk about government, e never show dat we dey point or bring out a positive thing “de gun way dey de room.” Almostly as we dey explain, governments are considered to be selected by and for de people, and to work with dere expressed or implicit approval.       

However, dis na pure rubbish.   

 If a man com put a knife for de throat of a woman com dey fork her, dat  one na by any means an act of rape. He nor fit say dat de fork na consensual, when he dey threatening to wound her or kpai her if she nor agree make e fork her. If de fork na realm between de man and woman, then de knife na completely unnecessary. If de man com feel to carry a knife, then clearly de fork na *not* willingly.      

In de same way, people dey talk dat taxation na part of de social contract dat dey com voluntarily agree to.

Dis one na both logically and empirically nor be true. 

We com know dat na empirically lie becos *nor social contact dey*. As if in you nor I *ever* com signed a paper voluntarily consenting to de money way dey com tax – dem com born us inside a system dat collect our money from us becos dey use gun dey point at us.  

### The Gun In The Room

Many people com dey argue at dis point dat collecting of tax dem nor use gun take point, but rather dat people com agree to pay am voluntarily. For example, dem never point a gun for my face by dose people who dey collect tax or a policeman, but I don pay tax for plenty years

 Dis e if be true, but it na completely irrelevant. If I com tell a woman dat I go kpai her pikin if she nor agree to allow me fork am, and she com agree make I fork am, we come clearly understand dat an immoral action don happen – even when I nor com use the weapon in my violation. Clearly, if de woman agree make I sleep with her, na becos she dey fear dat I go fit do her something. If I com tell her dat my pet leprechaun go kpai her pikins if she nor agree to sleep with me, she go com dey sorry, but she nor go dey fear warin I talk in any significant way, becos e nor dey possible make my pet leprechaun fit kpai her pikins.  
 
 Or, if I died, and my will stated that I would kill this woman’s children if she did not have sex with me, clearly she would feel relieved rather than afraid, since I cannot conceivably act out my threat from beyond the grave. Thus we pay taxes because we know that if we do not, the likelihood of being aggressed against by representatives of the state is very high. If I do not pay my taxes, I will get a letter, then another letter, then a phone call, then a summons to court – and if I do not appear in court, or do not pay my back taxes and accumulated fines and interest, policemen will come with guns to take me to jail. If I resist those policemen, they will shoot me down.

To say that force equals voluntarism is completely illogical and self-contradictory. To say that the initiation of the use of force is completely equal to the non-initiation of the use of force is to say that up is down, black is white, and truth is falsehood.

Without the “null zone,” these corrupt fictions cannot be sustained.

The “null zone” is the lair of the beast we hunt.

As we can see, we know that personally it is wrong to steal; we have very few problems with an abstract and logical ban on theft, such as we have worked out above – yet still, there exists this “null zone” or alternate universe where such oppositions can be accepted without any question or concern.

According to UPB, it is wrong for me and you to steal. Yet somehow, in this “null zone,” it is not only allowed, but also perfectly *moral*, for others to steal. We *must not* steal – they *must* steal. It is moral madness!

### Policemen

Let us take our good friend Bob away from his little room of moral theory testing and restore him to his original job as a policeman.

Clearly, when Bob wakes up in the morning, before his shift, he cannot go to his neighbour’s house and demand money at the point of a gun, no matter who tells him that it’s all right.

When Bob has his breakfast, he also cannot attack his neighbour and take his money. On his drive to work – even though he has put on his uniform – he has not punched in yet, and thus has no more rights than any other citizen. When he punches in, however, now, as if there descends an amoral pillar of fire from the very heavens, he gains the amazing ability to morally attack his neighbours and take their money.

Strangely, this is the only characteristic of his that has utterly reversed itself. He cannot fly, he cannot change his shape, he cannot successfully digest ball bearings or live in an inferno; he cannot run one thousand kilometres an hour, and neither can he walk through a brick wall. He is absolutely, utterly, and completely *the same man as he was **before** he punched in* – yet now, he is subject to completely opposite moral rules.

Even more strangely, if I am not a “policeman,” but I follow Bob to work, and do exactly what he does – I put on a costume, walk into the police station, and put a piece of cardboard into a punch clock – why, if I then do exactly what Bob does, I am completely and totally immoral, although Bob’s identical actions are completely and totally *moral*.

What kind of sense does this make? How can we conceivably unravel this impenetrable mystery?

The simple fact is that it *cannot* be unravelled, because it is completely deranged. The fact that this “opposite world” moral madness is completely irrational – not to mention violently exploitive – is so obvious that it must be buried in an endless cavalcade of mythological “voluntarism.”

We are told that we “want” Bob to take our money – which completely contradicts the fact that Bob shows up on our doorstep pointing a loaded gun in our face. By this logic, I can also go up and down the street stealing money from my neighbours, and then claim to be utterly shocked when I am arrested:

“They *want* me to take their money!”

“But then why were you threatening to shoot them if they did not give you their money?”

“Because they *owe* me their money!”

“I thought you said that they want to give you their money.”

“No, no – they owe me. It’s really *my* money!”

“On what grounds do they owe you this money?”

“We have a contract!”

“Can you show me this contract? Have they signed this contract of their own free will?”

“It’s not that kind of contract! It’s a – *social* contract… And besides – according to that social contract, I own the whole street anyway – the whole damn neighbourhood in fact! Anyone who refuses to pay me my money can move somewhere else – I’m not forcing anyone!”

“And how do you know that you own the whole neighbourhood? Do you have ownership papers?”

“Yes, of course – have a look here!”

“Well, this is just a handwritten note saying that you own the whole neighbourhood – and it’s the same handwriting as your signature. I’m afraid that we’re going to have to book you – this is just a made-up contract with yourself, which you are inflicting on other people at the point of a gun.”

This is as completely insane and corrupt as me continuing to tell a woman I am raping that she *wants* to have sex with me. Can you imagine if I were on trial for rape, and there was a videotape of the woman begging me to stop, and I had a knife to her throat, how my defence would be received if I continued to insist that she actually *wanted* to have sex with me?

In court, I would be reviled, and thrown into jail for my obvious, mad, corrupt and self-serving hypocrisy.

Ah, but in the “null zone” of government, rape is lovemaking, kidnapping is invitation, rejecting theft is evil selfishness, and coercion is kindness.

This is what I mean when I say that this “opposite world *null zone*” is the most fundamental barrier to human happiness the world over. Stealing is wrong for us; stealing is wrong in the abstract – but stealing is somehow “right” in this insane alternate universe called “government”?

[^2]: Let’s not even get *started* on the logical nightmare of the truth value contained in the statement “error equals truth.”

[^3]: This argument tends also not to work very well with maths teachers – I have never seen a student successfully argue that an incorrect answer may be correct in another universe, and so it is unjust to mark it as wrong.
